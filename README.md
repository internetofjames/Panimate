This repository was originally a project for Audio Software Development,
a class at Belmont University. 

Created for the Spring 2019 Semester.

This project was an attempt to develop an autopanner plugin using the JUCE
framework. It has now been made public, and serves as a demonstration of 
a novice attempt to build a plugin with the framework and implement a complex 
LFO class on the panning of the signal.
